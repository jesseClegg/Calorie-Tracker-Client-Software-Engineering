### If you are unsure about workflow:
- make a branch off of dev with the name of your proposed feature
- after implementing the feature, submit pull request to merge into dev
- try and keep branches to one feature or smaller features to avoid merge conflicts

### Instructions to run:
- must have node installed
- run rpm install (on first run)
- npm upate MAY be necessary
- npm start (nodemon also works)
